# Open-3SPN2
Implementation of the coarse-grained molecular model of DNA in OpenMM

3SPN.2 and 3SPN.2C is a DNA coarse-grained forcefield developed by the [de Pablo Group](https://pme.uchicago.edu/de_pablo_lab/research/dna_folding_and_hybridization/3spn.2/). Each DNA nucleotide contains 3 beads per particle (phosphate, sugar and nucleobase). This forcefield was adapted by the Wolynes group to model protein-DNA interactions as a complement for the [AWSEM](https://github.com/npschafer/openawsem) forcefield.
For details about the model itself and it's development, please see Hinckley et al., JCP, 139, 144903 ,2013 (DOI: 10.1063/1.4822042)
